• 15+ fractal types (2D and 3D)
• 50+ coloring algorithms
• GPU-accelerated 3D rendering
• Export up to 16K resolution

What makes this special:
✅ No installation required

### Reddit Post (r/generative, r/math, r/webdev)

**Title**: `I built a browser-based fractal explorer with 10^1000 zoom depth, 50+ coloring algorithms, and 3D raymarching — all in vanilla JS`

**Body**:
```
Hey everyone!

After [X] months of work, I'm releasing Abyss Explorer — probably the most ambitious browser-based fractal app I've seen.

**What it does:**
- 🔬 Zoom deeper than desktop apps using perturbation theory + series approximation
- 🎨 50+ coloring algorithms (orbit traps, distance estimation, histogram equalization...)
- 🌐 3D fractals with GPU raymarching (Mandelbulb, Mandelbox, Menger, etc.)
- 📍 2,500+ curated presets
- 📤 Export up to 16K

**Tech stack:**
- ~100k lines of vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- Web Workers for parallel computation
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Custom GLSL shaders
- No build step — just open index.html

**Try it:** [LINK]

**Source:** [GITHUB]

Would love feedback from this community! What features would you want to see?

Some interesting implementation details:
- Used perturbation theory from K.I. Martin's SuperFractalThing research
- Taylor series approximation skips millions of iterations at deep zooms
- Automatic glitch detection and reference orbit rebasing
- Formula parser for custom user fractals (z^3+sin(c*z) works!)

Happy to answer any technical questions!
```

### Hacker News Post

**Title**: `Show HN: Abyss Explorer – Browser-based fractal explorer with 10^1000 zoom depth`

**Text**:
```
I've been working on Abyss Explorer, a browser-based fractal explorer that achieves desktop-level zoom depths using perturbation theory and series approximation.

Demo: [LINK]
Source: [GITHUB]

Technical highlights:

- Perturbation theory allows zooming to 10^-1000 by computing deltas from a high-precision reference orbit
- Taylor series approximation skips iterations where coefficients remain valid
- Arbitrary precision arithmetic (embedded big.js) for extreme coordinates
- Web Workers parallelize computation across tiles
- 3D fractals use raymarching with GLSL distance estimators

The entire codebase is ~100k lines of vanilla ES6 JavaScript with no build step.

I'd appreciate any feedback on the implementation, especially from anyone familiar with fractal rendering optimization.
